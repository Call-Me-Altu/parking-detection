#🚗 Automatic Car Parking System Mobile App

## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to solve urban parking challenges by developing a smart mobile app that automatically detects and recommends suitable parking spaces based on real-time analysis. The app uses Bluetooth connectivity with the vehicle to predict parking availability and provide user-friendly guidance.
